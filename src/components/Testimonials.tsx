              "We are so thankful to the School of Greek Language and Culture, the amazing and dedicated teachers, and the wonderful sense of community we have built. Our older son has attended since the school opened its doors, and our younger son will start in the fall as he enters Kindergarten. Not only do they learn the language, but they learn about our beautiful culture, partake in Christmas celebrations where they sing and recite poems, go on educational field trips, and more. We can't wait to see our school and children continue to flourish!"

              "I arrived with my family here in Tampa before 10 months. We learned about the school from the Greek Consulate. From the first time we felt so nice and that we were a part of a big family. Every Saturday my son was so excited to come in this school because it was for him like being in Greece. The teachers were professional and give their best to learn the magic of the Greek language. At the school not only my child made friends but me and my wife as well. I have to admit that the Greek School in Tampa would be for me and my family a part of my life that we will never forget. Thank you so much."

              "The School of Greek Language and Culture has been a wonderful experience for my daughter! She is not only leaning to speak the Greek language, but also developing and learning to appreciate the rich historical and cultural traditions of Greece! The teachers are passionate about sharing their knowledge of the Greek Language and have coordinated numerous extra curricular field trips centered around providing real world experiences that go well beyond the typical classroom setting. From visiting the Ancient Greek history exhibit at the Tampa Museum of Art, to attending a performance of classical Greek piano music, and a scenic boat cruise through Tarpon Springs where they were taught the history of the Greeks who settled there. The school also participates in the Greek Independence Day parade where they march with their school banner through the historic Tarpon Springs! I greatly appreciate the passion and commitment of the instructors and their ability to create such a meaningful and engaging environment for the students and we are truly blessed to have had the continued opportunity to be a part of it!"

              "Our family has had such a wonderful experience at the Greek School of Tampa. Every Saturday, my kids look forward to going to class, where they are not only expanding their knowledge of our Greek language with well qualified teachers but also connecting with our heritage through music, history, and traditions. The educational program is engaging and thoughtfully designed incorporating cultural experiences like field trips and festive presentations. Our kids especially loved reciting their Greek poems and participating in cultural celebrations. We feel so fortunate to be part of such a warm, enriching community. We want nothing more than to see the school grow and thrive in the Tampa community."

              "In an era where culture has been spread out and generations of Greek language/culture is dissipating, the fact that this school has opened- is an opportunity for us to continue our Greek heritage- and we cannot pass that up! As a first generation Greek who went to Greek school for 6 years.. I knew that if I didn't find a way for my daughter to learn the language - it would end with me. I'm forever grateful that this school exists. It provides not only the continuance of the Greek language, but a place where children of Greek descent can gather as a community. There are no words to express the value in continuing the Greek heritage and language and not letting it disappear. The teachers do an excellent job putting together field trips/community gatherings .. the classroom setting is perfect to start and I only hope it continues to grow. It has been a wonderful experience."
